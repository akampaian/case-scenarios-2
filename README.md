Here are some examples of worst case scenarios;

Example 1; In the case when the maximum element is, at the end of the array or the array is sorted in descending order it will take n. 1 comparisons. The time complexity, represented by O notation is O(n).

Example 2; The provided codes worst case scenario happens when there are no elements in the array. In this case each element needs to be compared with every element using loops. The time complexity, represented by O notation is O(n^2).

Example 3; Consider a situation where you have two square matrices A and B both of size. X n. The worst case scenario arises when you need to compute matrix C by performing n x n multiplications and additions. The time complexity for this scenario represented by O notation is O(n^3).

Example 4; In the case for this code snippet the while loop continues executing until 'n' becomes 1. The time complexity for this scenario is logarithmic, with base 2 (logâ‚‚(n)) represented by O notation.

Example 5; As 'n' grows larger in this situation we encounter a challenging worst case scenario.
